\chapter{Research plan}\label{chap:6}

I plan to work on developing a decidable subtyping specification for the Julia
language and write a research paper on that.
As outlined in \chapref{chap:3}, I envision the type language to be close to the
one currently used in Julia, with some restrictions that ensure decidability
but support the majority of the existing code base.
As a first step, I will look into restricting lower bounds of existential type
variables, for lower bounds make it possible to encode the undecidable
system \FSub in Julia. Furthermore, taking into account the inconsistent
treatment of types due to the diagonal rule,
and the importance of concrete types for optimizations in the JIT compiler,
I propose to explicitly distinguish between regular existential types
and existential types where the type variable ranges over only concrete types.

I intend to do the technical work on decidable subtyping and submit a paper
for POPL 2023, with the deadline in July 2022.
After that, I intend to collaborate with the Julia developers on incorporating
decidable subtyping into the Julia language and work on the thesis.
I expect that the thesis will be completed in a year from the proposal time,
around February 2023.
