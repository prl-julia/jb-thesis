\chapter{Preliminary work}\label{chap:4}

%In this chapter, I briefly describe preliminary work
%related to subtyping and the role of types in Julia. %run-time semantics of Julia.

\paragraph{A reconstruction of Julia subtyping~\cite{TODO}.} 
This work is the result of a collaborative effort to provide a
readable specification of Julia subtyping.
Initially, an incomplete (and soon outdated) definition of subtyping existed only
in~\cite{TODO}, with the actual implementation of subtyping ($\sim$3000 lines of
heavily optimized C~code) being the only reference point.

In~\cite{TODO}, we define subtyping in the form of a judgment
\[
  \ljsub{E}{t}{t'}{E'}.
\]
Here, $E$ is a type variable environment that contains two kinds of variables,
forall (also called left) and exist (also called right).
A forall variable is added to the environment
when an existential type appears on the left of the subtyping judgment,
as in \cjl{(Vector\{X\} where X) <: t'}. Such variables never change in the
environment, which corresponds to the intuition that for a left-hand side
existential type,
subtyping should hold for all possible instantiations of the type variable.
However, when an existential type appears on the right,
as in \cjl{t <: Vector\{Q\} where Q}, the variable is
added as an exist variable. During subtype checking, such variables may accrue
subtype constraints in addition to their declared bounds; if all the constraints
are consistent, subtyping succeeds, which corresponds to the intuition that
for a right-hand side existential type, subtyping holds
if there exists a valid instantiation of the type variable. 
%Constraints on possible instantiations take the form of updated
%variable bounds, and these updates produce the environment~$E'$.
Exist-variables with updated bounds are recorded in the output environment~$E'$.
For example, if \cjl{Q} is an exist variable with bounds
\cjl{Union\{\}<:Q<:Any}, then
\[
  \ljsub{\mathtt{Q}_\text{\cjl{Union\{\}}}^\text{\cjl{Any}}}
    {\text{\cjl{Int}}}{\mathtt{Q}}
    {\mathtt{Q}_\text{\cjl{Int}}^\text{\cjl{Any}}},
\]
i.e., \cjl{Int<:Q} results in updating \cjl{Q} to \cjl{Int<:Q<:Any}.

Having reconstructed the specification of Julia subtyping,
we were able to identify its undecidability. Furthermore, this work highlighted
several other problems, e.g. the lack of transitivity,
which I plan to address in the thesis.
%For example, the diagonal rule (discussed in \secref{sec:2:subtyping})
%is applied not to an isolated type, but based on the subtyping check with
%another type. As a result, the same existential type may be constrained to
%a concrete type variable in one subtyping judgment but not the other.
%This makes it hard, if not impossible, to reason about properties of subtyping
%such as reflexivity and transitivity.

\paragraph{Tag-based semantic subtyping for nominal types, tuples, and
unions~\cite{TODO}.}
Although subtyping in Julia is intended to follow the semantic subtyping
intuition, there is no formal set-theoretic model of Julia types.
In \cite{TODO}, I proposed and mechanized in Coq~\cite{TODO}
a semantic interpretation of (a subset of) Julia
types \ty as sets of type tags \gty, which correspond to concrete types.
Then, for a language of non-parametric nominal types, tuples, and unions,
subtyping can be defined as the set inclusion of interpretations
$\interp{\ty} \subseteq \interp{\ty'}$.
% While the treatment of tuples and unions is completely standard, nominal types
% are not as straightforward: interpreting an abstract type as a set of
% its concrete subtypes (e.g. $\interp{\text{\cjl{Signed}}} =
% \{\text{\cjl{Int8, Int16, ..., Int128}}\}$) would lead to brittle programs.
% Namely, because subtyping is used at run time to process method definitions and 
% dynamic dispatch, defining a new concrete subtype of an abstract type would
% change the subtyping relation and
% could cause the existing code to execute differently.
%It is worth emphasizing that Julia subtyping contradicts the set-theoretic
%interpretation in its treatment of the bottom type \cjl{Union\{\}}.
%Semantically, both \cjl{Union\{\}} and \cjl{Tuple\{Union\{\}\}} represent the
%empty set and are thus equivalent. However, in Julia,
%\cjl{Tuple\{Union\{\}\}} is not a subtype of \cjl{Union\{\}}.

Following up on this work, I extended the interpretation to support
the bottom and top types, as well as
invariant type constructors such as \cjl{Vector\{...\}}.
In the new system, types are given an indexed interpretation $\interp{\cdot}_n$.
%However, in the presence of invariant type constructors such as \cjl{Vector\{...\}},
%types are given an indexed interpretation $\interp{\cdot}_n$.
In particular, a concrete type constructor \cjl{Name\{...\}} is interpreted as
\[
\interp{\text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty\text{\cjl{\}}}}_{n+1} =
\{ \text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty'\text{\cjl{\}}}
\ |\ \interp{\ty'}_n = \interp{\ty}_n \},
\]
and subtyping is defined as
\[
  \ty <: \ty' \quad \equiv \quad
  \forall n.\ \interp{\ty}_n \subseteq \interp{\ty'}_n.
\]
The reason $\text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty\text{\cjl{\}}}$ is not interpreted simply as
a singleton set $\{ \text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty\text{\cjl{\}}} \}$
is that because of the union and bottom types,
there are multiple syntactic representations of the same type.
Therefore, any type tag %$\text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty\text{\cjl{\}}}$ and
$\text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty'\text{\cjl{\}}}$ %can have syntactically different
%but semantically equivalent type parameters \ty and $\ty'$.
such that $\ty'$ is equivalent to $\ty$ should be included in the interpretation
of $\{ \text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty\text{\cjl{\}}} \}$.
Despite the more complex indexed interpretation, the subtype relation has
an equivalent, standard syntactic definition $\ty \leq \ty'$ where
$\text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty\text{\cjl{\}}} \leq
\text{\cjl{Name\{}}\ty'\text{\cjl{\}}}$
holds if $\ty \leq \ty'$ and $\ty' \leq \ty$.
This extension is also mechanized in Coq.

% \paragraph{A model of Julia's JIT~\cite{TODO}.}
% Using an abstract machine modeled after Julia's JIT compiler, this work formally
% defines the property of a method definition that impacts the ability of
% the compiler to optimize the code: the property is called type stability.
% Although type stability is not directly related to the topic of this thesis
% proposal, having defined a model of the JIT compiler, I found that
% (1)~the correctness of JIT compilation depends on the soundness of type
% inference, and (2)~concrete types and the ability of type inference to infer
% concrete types of expressions are conducive to optimizations.
% These observations emphasize that despite Julia being a dynamic language,
% subtyping and the type language are an integral part of the compiler
% and Julia's performance.
