% Julia is a dynamic, high-level, yet high-performance programming language
% for scientific computing.
% To encourage a high level of code reuse and extensibility, Julia is
% designed around symmetric multiple dynamic dispatch, which allows functions
% to have multiple implementations tailored to different argument types.
% To resolve multiple dispatch, Julia relies on a subtype relation over a complex
% language of run-time types and type annotations, which include parametric types,
% untagged unions that distribute over covariant tuples, and impredicative
% existential types.
% Notably, Julia's subtyping is undecidable.
% Unlike in statically typed languages
% with undecidable subtyping, e.g. Scala, where the undecidability manifests at
% compile time, in Julia, it leads to a run-time stack overflow error. 
% This can happen
% at almost any point during the program execution, as subtyping is used to
% resolve every function call.
% In this thesis, I propose to develop a decidable subtype relation
% for the Julia language,
% such that migrating existing code would require minimal effort.
% In particular, to provide for decidability, I will restrict the language of type
% annotations. To evaluate the migration effort, I will check whether
% type annotations used in registered Julia packages conform to the proposed
% restriction.
