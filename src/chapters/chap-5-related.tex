Subtyping is typically associated with object-oriented programming languages and
static type systems. As a part of a type system, subtyping allows
an expression of a more specific type (subtype) to be used in place
where an expression of a more general type (supertype) is expected,
enabling more benign programs to be typable.

Although decidability is desirable for a static type system, establishing
decidability can be challenging and may take years.
For example, the \emph{un}decidability of Java generics was 
established only fairly recently by~\citet{grigore:java-undec:2017},
and the previously suspected undecidability of the core calculus of Scala 3,
DOT, was proven by~\citet{hu:dot-undec:2020}.
In both cases, the undecidability of the type system is a consequence of
undecidable subtyping.
Practically, the undecidability of a type system manifests itself with
the compiler crashing or not terminating. In some cases,
benefits of having a more expressive type system might outweigh the cost of
undecidability: if the undecidability arises only in rare, contrived cases,
being able to type more benign programs at the cost of rare compiler crashes
might be preferable to being able to type fewer programs
with a decidable but less expressive type system.
Identifying decidable fragments of undecidable type systems remains
an important challenge~\cite{mackay:path-dep-dec:2020,
hu:dot-undec:2020,mackay:bound-poly-sub-dec:2020,kennedy:nom-sub-var-dec:2007}.

Apart from a static type system,
subtyping can also be used at run time for type tests and casts,
in which case its decidability becomes more important: otherwise, a crash or
non-termination could happen during program execution rather than compilation.
Run-time types can be more restrictive than static types, which
simplifies the corresponding subtyping problem.
For example, subtyping between ground types in the .NET intermediate
language is decidable~\cite{kennedy:nom-sub-var-dec:2007},
and with the type erasure mechanism in Java generics,
its run-time subtyping is decidable too.

Subtyping and decidability of subtyping are clearly a problem in various languages,
but we will focus on several related subsets.

\section{Semantic subtyping}
%% ======================================================================

In Julia, subtyping of union and tuple types (maybe also invariant ones?) build
on top of \TODO{Voulon} and has similarities to XDuce/CDuce.
There is a large body of work on semantic subtyping, which extends it to
function and polymorphic types. However, such systems do not deal with
impredicative types.
For example, \citet{frih:sem-sub:2008} describe a framework for defining semantic
subtyping without building a model of the entire language, and then define
decidable subtyping and type checking for a language with dynamic dispatch,
unions, functions, and negation types.\TODO{clean up the description}

In the semantic subtyping approach, types are interpreted as subsets of the
model of the programming
