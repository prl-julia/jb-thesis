\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chap:eval}

\paragraph{Packages.}
Used \url{https://github.com/julbinb/JuliaPkgsList.jl} to get a list of
Julia packages.
The info is taken from a JSON file at
\url{https://juliahub.com/app/packages/info}.
(JuliaHub is listed as a service for searching all registered packages
here: \url{https://julialang.org/packages/}).

There were 9355 entries listed as of 2022-05-28.
The tool extracts package name and latest version.
Some entries in the JSON file were not proper registered packages,
e.g. it contained the Julia repo itself, which is not a registered package.
Some repositories are no longer open and cannot be accessed.
Some repos did not have a version (31).

9315 packages were successfully downloaded using
\url{https://github.com/julbinb/JuliaPkgDownloader.jl/}.

\paragraph{Analysis.}
Static analysis of type annotations in the downloaded packages.
Here is cloc info:

\begin{verbatim}
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Language         files          blank        comment           code
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Julia            172024        3830817        1937753       19476938
\end{verbatim}

All Julia files (i.e. files with .jl extension) were parsed using
the Julia parser.

206 packages had files that could not be parsed.

After parsing, type annotations were extracted using MacroTools.jl:
\begin{itemize}
    \item method signatures, e.g. \cjl{f(x::T, v::Vector\{T\}) where T}
      is transformed into \cjl{Tuple\{T, Vector\{T\}\} where T}
    \item if there is a return type anotation, it is counted as a separate type
    \item with the exception of method type signatures, all \cjl{t} from
        \cjl{::t}, which includes field type annotations, run-time type assertions,
        and local variable type annotations
\end{itemize}

Some type annotations could not be properly processed, e.g. because of macros
\begin{verbatim}
Error: Couldn't process type annotation
  tastr = "(Tuple{A} where Base.IteratorSize(A)::Base.SizeUnknown) where A"
  err = AssertionError: Unsupported lb-var-ub format

Error: Couldn't process type annotation
  tastr = "(((Tuple{(\$T_nameparam){\$N, \$M, \$FT}} where \$FT) where \$M) where \$N) where \$(T_params...)"
  err = AssertionError: Unsupported lb-var-ub format
\end{verbatim}
Total of 1629 packages had at least one error like that.

Total 2136609 type annotations were found. Out of those:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1573 couldn't be processed at all (e.g. as described above): usually
        because a type variable binding couldn't be parsed
    \item 22396 were partially processed, e.g. if one element of a tuple was
        a \$-thingy, it was ignored when type variable occurrence was analyzed
\end{itemize}

2135030 satisfy the restriction, 6 were reported as not satisfying.

2135030 + 6 + 1573 (errors) = 2136609, checks out.

Types that syntactically do not fit the restriction but are trivially
equivalent (involve tuples) were considered good by the analysis.
